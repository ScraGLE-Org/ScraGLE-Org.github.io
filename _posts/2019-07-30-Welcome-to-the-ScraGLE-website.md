We've finally got around to creating a website for ScraGLE. The neat thing about it is that it's managed directly from within 
a github repository, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted as a set of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
at github.io.

In time we plan to populate this website with details of the ScraGLE code demos we are creating as well as user documentation 
and curriculum materials. For now, we will post progress updates to this blog as the toolkit and supporting materials start 
to take shape.
