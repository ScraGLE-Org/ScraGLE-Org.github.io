title: ScraGLE - About Us
---
<div class="blurb">
	<h1>So... what is ScraGLE?</h1>
	<p>ScraGLE is a Scratch 3 based game development toolkit containing</p>
				
  <ul>
  <li>a fully documented set of code demos</li>
  <li>a library of game-ready assets (animated sprites, backgrounds, sounds & soundtracks)</li>
  <li>curriculum materials</li>
  <li>a fully playable example game that showcases the use of the code demos</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Its aim is to bridge the gap that currently exists between starter projects aimed at beginners, 
  such as those written by [Code Club](https://codeclub.org/en/) or [Coder Dojo](https://coderdojo.com/), 
  and more professional game development using 3D game engines such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), 
	  [Kodu](https://www.kodugamelab.com/) and [Unity](https://unity.com/).</p>
  
< br>
	
  <p>By developing ScraGLE we hope to provide kids with more knowledge and experience of game design and development 
  challenges and techniques within the familiar Scratch 3 blocks-based environment. The curriculum material that 
  we are developing alongside ScraGLE makes it ideal for use in code clubs, coder dojos, raspberry jams, in the 
	  classroom and at home.</p>
