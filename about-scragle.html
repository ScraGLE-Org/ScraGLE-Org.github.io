title: ScraGLE - About Us

<div class="blurb">
	<h1>So... what is ScraGLE?</h1>
	<p>ScraGLE is a Scratch 3 based game development toolkit containing</p>
				
  <ul>
  <li>a fully documented set of code demos</li>
  <li>a library of game-ready assets (animated sprites, backgrounds, sounds & soundtracks)</li>
  <li>curriculum materials</li>
  <li>a fully playable example game that showcases the use of the code demos</li>
  </ul>


  <p>
	  Its aim is to bridge the gap that currently exists between starter projects aimed at beginners, 
	  such as those written by <a href="https://codeclub.org/en/">Code Club</a> or <a href="https://coderdojo.com/">Coder Dojo</a>,
	  and more professional game development using 3D game engines such as <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, 
	  <a href="https://www.kodugamelab.com/">Kodu</a> and <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>.
</p>
  <p>
	  By developing ScraGLE we hope to provide kids with more knowledge and experience of game design and development 
	  challenges and techniques within the familiar Scratch 3 blocks-based environment. The curriculum material that 
	  we are developing alongside ScraGLE makes it ideal for use in code clubs, coder dojos, raspberry jams, in the 
	  classroom and at home.
